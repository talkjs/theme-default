# Default theme for TalkJS Components v2

The `@talkjs/theme-default` package contains the default theme for the [`@talkjs/components` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@talkjs/components), which provides chat UI components for [TalkJS](https://talkjs.com). When combined with `@talkjs/components`, it lets you display a chat with any frontend framework, such as Angular, Vue or Svelte.

## Prerequisites

To use this package, you will need a [TalkJS account](https://talkjs.com/dashboard/login). TalkJS provides a ready-to-use chat client for your application. Your account gives you access to TalkJS's free development environment.

## Installation

If you're using React, install both `@talkjs/theme-default` and the [ `@talkjs/components` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@talkjs/components):

```sh
npm install @talkjs/components @talkjs/theme-default
# or
yarn add @talkjs/components @talkjs/theme-default
```

If you're using another framework, you'll also need to add the `react` and `react-dom` dependencies:

```sh
npm install @talkjs/components @talkjs/theme-default react react-dom
# or
yarn add @talkjs/components @talkjs/theme-default react react-dom
```

For examples of how to use `@talkjs/default-theme` with `@talkjs/components`, see [Examples](https://talkjs.com/docs/Reference/Components/Reference/Chatbox/#examples) in the TalkJS docs.
